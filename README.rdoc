Mconf-Web is the web application that provides access to web conferences in Mconf-Live or BigBlueButton servers.

You can try out Mconf-Web at our free demo server at http://mconf.org.

Mconf-Web connects to an Mconf-Live or a {BigBlueButton}[http://www.bigbluebutton.org/] server and allows the users to create and participate in web conferences. It provides functionalities that are (by design) not implemented in the core of Mconf-Live/BigBlueButton, such as:

* User authentication;
* Permission control to access web conference rooms;
* Follows a social network model with spaces (communities) that have events;
* Users have their own web conferences that they can share with other members or even invite external participants;
* Each space also has a web conference room that the members can use to interact;
* Events can be used to schedule web conferences.
